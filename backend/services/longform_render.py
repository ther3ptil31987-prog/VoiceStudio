"""Shared long-form render core (Stories + Audiobook convergence).

Both the Audiobook tab and the Stories Editor produce the *same* artifact: a
chapter-marked audio file built from chapter WAVs. This module owns the pure,
engine-agnostic ffmpeg/metadata builders for that mux so neither feature has to
reimplement it:

  * ``build_ffmetadata`` — FFMETADATA1 doc: an optional ``[global]`` tag block
    (title / author / narrator / year / genre / description) followed by one
    ``[CHAPTER]`` per (title, duration_ms).
  * ``build_concat_list`` — ffmpeg concat-demuxer list of chapter WAVs.
  * ``build_loudnorm_filter`` — an ``-af loudnorm=…`` string for an ACX /
    podcast loudness preset (off by default — opt-in, so the default-behavior
    stays platform-identical).
  * ``validate_cover_image`` — guard a cover path (type + size) before it
    reaches ffmpeg.
  * ``build_render_cmd`` — pure argv for the mux: chapter WAVs + FFMETADATA
    (+ optional cover art, loudness filter), output as ``m4b`` or ``mp3``.
  * ``chapter_cache_key`` — deterministic content hash so a re-run reuses
    already-rendered chapters (resume) and re-renders only what changed.
  * ``segment_cache_key`` / ``SegmentCache`` — the inner cache layer: each
    spoken span's WAV is content-addressed under ``<cache_dir>/segments`` so
    editing one sentence re-renders one segment (not the chapter) and an
    interrupted chapter render resumes from its finished segments.

The builders are pure (string/argv in, string/argv out) so they're unit tested
without ffmpeg, torch, or a GPU; the cache helpers (``prune_cache_dir``,
``SegmentCache``) touch only local files and import torch lazily. The impure
ffmpeg run lives in the caller (the audiobook router today; the stories job
tomorrow).
