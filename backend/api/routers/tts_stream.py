"""
Streaming TTS via WebSocket — v1.0.x ultra-low-latency audio delivery.

Client sends a text request, server streams back audio chunks in real-time
as they're generated. This unlocks:
  • Real-time voice assistants (speak-back mode)
  • Dictation widget with live audio preview
  • Interactive dubbing preview without waiting for full generation

Protocol:
    → Client sends JSON: {"text": "...", "voice": "profile_id", ...}
    ← Server sends binary audio chunks (PCM16 @ 24kHz mono) as generated
    ← Server sends JSON: {"type": "done", "duration_s": 4.2,
      "gen_time_s": 1.1, "ttfa_ms": 180.0, "rtf": 0.262}
    ← Server sends JSON: {"type": "error", "detail": "..."}

The chunked delivery targets <100ms time-to-first-audio (TTFA) on warm models.
