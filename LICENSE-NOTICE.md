# VoiceStudio — License Notice

## Abbreviation

AGPL-3.0-only

## Notice

Copyright 2024-present Palash Debnath and VoiceStudio contributors.

VoiceStudio is **free and open-source software, licensed under the GNU
Affero General Public License, Version 3 (AGPL-3.0)**. You are free to use,
copy, modify, and redistribute it. That **includes commercial and internal
business use** of the application itself. Model weights, tokenizers, and other
third-party assets retain their own terms; this application license does not
grant or summarize rights under those separate terms.

Because this is the **Affero** GPL, one additional obligation applies: if you
modify VoiceStudio and make that modified version available to others over
a network, you must also offer those users the complete corresponding source
code of your modified version under these same AGPL-3.0 terms. See the full
text in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

Commercial use under the AGPL-3.0 is free. What is paid is a **commercial
license** for organizations that want to embed VoiceStudio in a closed-source or
proprietary product or service without the AGPL-3.0 copyleft obligations, and
the VoiceStudio Pro features. See the plans at <https://voicestudio.sh/pro>; for
other inquiries contact `hi@voicestudio.sh`.

Contributors license their contributions to Yupcha Softwares Private Limited,
the company that maintains VoiceStudio, under the
[Contributor License Agreement](.github/CLA-1.0.md). While a contribution is
in the public repository, it stays available there under the AGPL-3.0 or
another OSI-approved licence (CLA section 4).

(This Notice is a plain-language summary; the binding terms are the full GNU
AGPL-3.0 text in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).)

### Scope

These terms cover the VoiceStudio application — the Electron desktop and web
app (`electron/`), its native desktop helper (`native/`), the FastAPI backend
(`backend/`), and supporting build / packaging files (`scripts/`, `deploy/`,
`.github/`). Electron components adapted from T3 Code keep their MIT notice in
`electron/T3CODE-LICENSE.txt`.

The bundled `omnivoice/` Python package — the underlying TTS model by Han Zhu —
is **separately licensed under Apache License 2.0** by its upstream authors and
is not relicensed here. Apache License 2.0 is compatible with, and may be
combined under, the GNU AGPL-3.0. See `pyproject.toml`.

Downloaded model weights are not relicensed by VoiceStudio. The default
`k2-fsa/OmniVoice` model card identifies its code as Apache-2.0 and pretrained
weights as CC-BY-NC. Its `audio_tokenizer/LICENSE` contains separate Boson
Higgs Audio 2 and Meta Llama community terms. A commercial license for
VoiceStudio-owned code does not replace any of those terms.

The maintained About panel displays selected model credits and required literal
Higgs Audio and Llama attribution text. See [model credit sources](docs/model-credits.md)
for evidence and remaining gaps. These visible credits do not establish complete
notice compliance or permission for a particular use.

The [model licence records](backend/config/model_licenses.json) distinguish
inspected non-commercial terms from unreviewed upstream metadata. A false
commercial-use flag includes unresolved review; it is not a claim that every
listed model forbids commercial use. No commercial clearance is asserted by
the initial inventory.

Third-party dependencies retain their own licenses. See `bun.lock`, `uv.lock`,
and `native/desktop-bridge/Cargo.lock` for the resolved set.

The locked PyAV 15.1.0 wheels bundle FFmpeg and x264/x265 libraries. PyAV's source
licence alone does not describe those binaries' terms. The
[wheel audit](docs/licensing/pyav-15.1.0-audit.md) records their hashes, build flags,
upstream licence-label patch, and unresolved redistribution requirements.

### Reference

The full canonical text of the GNU Affero General Public License, Version 3 is
reproduced verbatim in [`LICENSE`](LICENSE). The authoritative copy lives at
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.txt>.

> **Why this notice is a separate file:** `LICENSE` must contain the verbatim
> AGPL-3.0 text and nothing else, so GitHub's license detection (and the
> corporate license scanners that gate adoption) can identify it as
> `AGPL-3.0-only` rather than falling back to "Other" / `NOASSERTION`.
